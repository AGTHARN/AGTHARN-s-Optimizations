### ‚û°Ô∏è Asynchronous Explosion Calculator
On PMMP, the explosion computation is not asynchronous. Given that you would be dealing with concurrent calculations, this assignment may prove to be difficult.

**For this method, simply put, the computation of explosions ought to be done on a separate thread from the main thread**. You would have issues if there were multiple explosions at the same chunk. For instance, it would be challenging to modify a chunk given how many computations were still being performed on it.

There are, of course, a few approaches to resolving this problem, such as a queue where explosion calculations are queued in accordance with the chunk(s) they blast. Another approach is to stop the modification of chunks while a new explosion is being computed (also known as chunk locking).

### ‚û°Ô∏è Unnecessary Entity Updates
Specific types of servers require lots of entities. While of course there are ways you can prevent large amount of entities (such as stacking or despawning), there are specific cases where entities cannot be despawned.

For instance, minions are commonly present in most servers, and players enjoy piling them up. There are more entities to update/tick when more minions are placed. The performance of the server may suffer greatly as a result. 

Therefore, removing pointless updates from the entity class's `onUpdate()` and `entityBaseTick()` methods would help. 

How so you may ask? For instance, I don't anticipate that minions will have any motion updates or health/hunger updates so those were removed. **Performance was then greatly enhanced just by eliminating unnecessary updates**. You may apply this to any type of entity.

### ‚û°Ô∏è XP Orbs
As XP orbs are frequently used by servers, they are unquestionably a must for PMMP servers. However, what if someone had left hundreds of XP orbs on their base in an effort to slow the server? Without a doubt, these XP orbs will ultimately de-spawn, but does it address the lag issue at its root?

If you haven't tried it yet, it significantly increases lag because these XP orbs must constantly move in the direction of a player (which causes motion updates). Like any other entity, motion updates can create lag when there are a lot of them present. 

**SOLUTIONS (that remove features):**

1. The ****motion updates on XP orbs can be eliminated**** as a potential solution to this problem. However, client-sided limitations causes these XP orbs to move on the client even if the server has stopped motion updates. I do believe it would be much better if you allowed your players the autonomy of being able to produce XP orbs.

2. There is also the option to **split XP to only ONE orb**. For instance, using a Bottle of Enchanting would cause the XP to be divided into many orbs, which is a default behavior. I do not believe that this is necessary, though, unless you are concerned that the XP orb would disappear for whatever reason.

3. The final option would be to prevent the spawning of any XP orbs with Bottle of Enchanting. As an alternative, it would **immediately go to the player's XP level**.

### ‚û°Ô∏è PHP 8 JIT
A just-in-time compiler was added to PHP 8 that significantly speeds up code execution. The JIT, however, is still in its experimental stage and presents certain [complications](https://github.com/dktapps/php-8-jit-bugs), particularly when utilizing the xDebug tool for debugging. Occasionally, depending on the circumstances, it can even result in decreased performance. 

Enabling can be done within `php.ini`. Further configuration may be required.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Liquid Flow
Lava or water are examples of liquid flow. Due to the number of scheduled block updates, the server may lag if water or lava is placed or drained. It depends entirely on the size and maximum decay.

The impact on performance may only be very slight and does not really significantly impair the server's performance. However, if you really want to go to the extreme, you may make the water flow instantly. 

There are some plugins like [this](https://github.com/Muqsit/AggressiveOptz) and [this](https://github.com/ItsMax123/NoWaterLagg) which I have not used before but may be of interest for you.
