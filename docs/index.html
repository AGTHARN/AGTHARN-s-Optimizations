<p>The sole purpose of this was only to provide some light over the experiments I have done on PMMP to my friends. It was never intended for the public to read this. Although all the comments I have gotten were negative, I will not let your comments influence my work.</p>
<p>This project was also <strong>NOT MEANT FOR ANY PRODUCTION PURPOSES</strong>. All of these methods can cause problems for your server, especially if your server requires PvP action. It is indeed undeniable that PlayerAuthInput is way better than PlayerMovement and I must accept that. <strong>I only made this so as to document my findings after my experiments on PMMP</strong>. Even if you used these methods, you MUST accept all the consequences involved! Overall, all these methods are entirely arguable.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-i-want-to-spend-time-on-such-experiments">Why did I want to spend time on such experiments?</h2>
<p>I myself run a PocketMine-MP (PMMP) server, and I&#39;ve been dealing with the same problem since the server&#39;s inception - lag brought on by high player counts rendering PMMP servers virtually unplayable.</p>
<p>Many individuals have frequently used the argument that the problem is with the server&#39;s plugins or that PMMP is single-threaded. That&#39;s not totally true, but it&#39;s comparable.</p>
<p>One day, I pondered how much I could change PMMP in order to push it as far as it could go. The experiments I have produced offer favourable performance enhancements.</p>

<p><strong>Due to the player count, the findings may be skewed, however if necessary, you can perform your own computations.</strong></p>

<p>The modifications I&#39;ve made are ones that a skilled developer could do with ease. Since they are not the finest, I do not intend to release a fork of these modifications. However, I&#39;d like to see somebody else give it a go.</p>
