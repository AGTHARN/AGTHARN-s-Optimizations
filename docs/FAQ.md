<details>
<summary>➡️ Will these methods break my server?</summary>
<br>
Depending on the category you're considering. If you're looking at reliable methods, there shouldn't be any issues as long as you know what you're doing. On the other hand, if you're referring to unreliable methods, more issues will arise and needs to be fixed.

<details>
<summary>➡️ How do I get your version of PMMP where you've attempted most of the methods?</summary>
<br>
You can't as I will not allow it. These were only tests, and this repository is solely intended for recording my discoveries — other servers are permitted to utilize it but I will not be held liable for any issues that arise.
</details>

<details>
<summary>➡️ Why is the player count on the before-after comparison not fair?</summary>
<br>
The player count displayed for my modified version of PMMP is incorrect. It's a problem that resulted from one of my own adjustments. However, because the information was gathered from a Skyblock server, the quantity of players is equal to the quantity of loaded worlds.

<summary>➡️ You do realize setting the world tick later is a terrible idea?</summary>
<br>
On this point, I do agree with you. It would be challenging to employ that approach though since you have to manually repair the problems that result from doing so. You have to ensure that entity updates are not impacted by world tick modifications. You must not interfere with player updates since entities must update correctly.

If you think PMMP shouldn't be consuming so many resources for the server, if necessary, I would like you to attempt managing an 80-player SkyBlock server.

<summary>➡️ The legacy movement system is not great. Why'd you want to use it again?</summary>
<br>
I do also agree with you. Server authoritative movement will reduce the number of issues and exposed vulnerabilities. However, only use the legacy movement if you're willing to sacrifice them for better performance.

# Specific Category - Unreliable
<details>
<summary>➡️ Out of everything, tick skipping? Seriously? </summary>
<br>
I included tick skipping in that category as it is one of the worst methods ever. This would be advantageous in terms of preserving the TPS. I do agree with you, though, that performing actions on certain ticks will be very difficult if ticks are skipped. Although I have tested such a system before, tick skipping is not something I advise.

Please stay away from it.
