<details>
<summary>➡️ Will these methods break my server?</summary>
<br>
Depending on the category you're considering. If you're looking at reliable methods, there shouldn't be any issues as long as you know what you're doing. On the other hand, if you're referring to unreliable methods, other issues will arise and needs to be fixed.

<summary>➡️ How do I get your version of PMMP where you've attempted most of the methods?</summary>
<br>
You can't. I will not allow it. These were only tests, and this repository is solely intended for recording my discoveries—other servers are not permitted to utilize it. If you'd want to try some of the methods as well, feel free, but I won't be held liable for any issues that arise.

<details>
<summary>➡️ Why is the player count on the before-after comparison not fair?</summary>
<br>
The player count displayed for the modified version is inaccurate. It's a problem that resulted from one of my own adjustments, and it's all my fault. However, because the information was gathered from a Skyblock server, the quantity of players is equal to the quantity of loaded worlds.

<summary>➡️ You do realize making the world tick later is a terrible idea?</summary>
<br>
On this point, I do agree with you. It would be challenging to employ that approach though since you have to manually repair the problems that result from doing so. You have to ensure that entity updates are not impacted by world tick modifications. You must not interfere with player updates since entities must update correctly.

If you think PMMP shouldn't be consuming so many resources for the world, I would like you to attempt managing a 80-player SkyBlock server. Collecting information from actual players is challenging.

<summary>➡️ The legacy movement system is not great. Why'd you want to use it again?</summary>
<br>
I do also agree with you. Server authoritative movement will reduce the number of issues and exposed vulnerabilities. However, only use the legacy movement if you're willing to sacrifice them for better performance.

<summary>➡️ Out of everything, tick skipping? Seriously? </summary>
<br>
I included tick skipping in that category for that purpose. This would be advantageous in terms of preserving the TPS. I do agree with you, though, that performing actions on certain ticks will be very difficult if ticks are skipped. Although I tested with it, tick skipping is not something I advise.
