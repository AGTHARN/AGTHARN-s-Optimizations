### ➡️ Tick Skipping
Actions on the server are slowed down along with lag. There is little you can do to prevent delays, but there are a few ways to partially resolve this.

Lag can cause the server to slow down by several ticks, which makes the server stagnate. Rather than the server waiting for a specified tick to be reached so that actions are performed on that tick. **We ignore the ticks that have been delayed for too long and consider it as lost**.

I am aware that skipping ticks isn't a great idea which is why this is entirely unreliable. However, it may provide room for other actions. You may set-up some sort of priority list for specific actions that can be skipped and some that cannot.
