<p>Actions on the server are slowed down along with lag. There is little you can do to prevent delays, but there are a few ways to partially resolve this.</p>
<p>Lag can cause the server to slow down by several ticks, which makes the server stagnate. Rather than the server waiting for a specified tick to be reached so that actions are performed on that tick. <strong>We ignore the ticks that have been delayed for too long and consider it as lost</strong>.</p>
<p>I am aware that skipping ticks isn&#39;t a great idea which is why this is entirely unreliable. However, it may provide room for other actions. </p>
