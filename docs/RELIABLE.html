<p>On PMMP, the explosion computation is not asynchronous. Given that you would be dealing with concurrent calculations, this assignment may prove to be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>For this method, simply put, the computation of explosions ought to be done on a separate thread from the main thread</strong>. You would have issues if there were multiple explosions at the same chunk. For instance, it would be challenging to modify a chunk given how many computations were still being performed on it.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a few approaches to resolving this problem, such as a queue where explosion calculations are queued in accordance with the chunk(s) they blast. Another approach is to stop the modification of chunks while a new explosion is being computed. </p>

<p>On my server, minions are present, and players enjoy piling them up. There are more entities to update/tick when more minions are placed. The performance of the server may suffer greatly as a result. </p>
<p>Therefore, I removed pointless updates from the entity class&#39;s <code>onUpdate()</code> and <code>entityBaseTick()</code> functions. For instance, I don&#39;t anticipate that minions will have any motion so I had that removed from its updates. <strong>Performance can already be enhanced just by eliminating unnecessary updates</strong>. You may do the same for any entity which you do not expect to be moving such as NPCs most of the time.</p>

<p>As XP orbs are frequently used by servers, they are unquestionably a must for PMMP servers. But what if someone had left hundreds of XP orbs on their base in an effort to slow the server? If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, it significantly increases lag because these XP orbs must constantly move in the direction of a player. Without a doubt, these XP orbs will ultimately de-spawn, but does it address the lag issue at its root? Like any other entity, XP orbs have motion updates that create lag when there are a lot of them present. </p>
<p><strong>The ways of solving this issue will remove features!</strong></p>
<p>The <strong><strong>motion updates on XP orbs can be eliminated</strong></strong> as a potential solution to this problem. However, I believe it would be much better if you allowed your players the autonomy of being able to produce XP orbs.</p>
<p>There is also the option to <strong>split XP to only ONE orb</strong>. For instance, using a Bottle of Enchanting would cause the XP to be divided into many orbs, which is a default behavior. I do not believe that this is necessary, though, unless you are concerned that the XP orb would disappear for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The final option would be to prevent the spawning of any XP orbs with Bottle of Enchanting. As an alternative, it would <strong>immediately go to the player&#39;s XP level</strong>.</p>
