# AGTHARN's Optimization Theories
[![Hits](https://hits.sh/github.com/AGTHARN/PMMP-Optimizations.svg?view=today-total&style=flat-square&label=views)](https://hits.sh/github.com/AGTHARN/PMMP-Optimizations/)

I myself run a PocketMine-MP (PMMP) server, and I've been dealing with the same problem since the server's inception - lag brought on by high player counts rendering PMMP servers virtually unplayable.

Many individuals have frequently used the argument that the problem is with the server's plugins or that PMMP is single-threaded. That's not totally true, but it's comparable.

One day, I pondered how much I could change PMMP in order to push it as far as it could go. The experiments I have produced offer fantastic performance enhancements.

**Due to the player count, the findings may be skewed, however if necessary, you can perform your own computations.**

The modifications I've made are ones that a skilled developer could do with ease. Since they are not the finest, I do not intend to release a fork of these modifications. However, I'd like to see somebody else give it a go.
